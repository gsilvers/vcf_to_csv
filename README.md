# vcf_to_csv
A simple utility to convert VCF virtual contact files to CSV

# Summary

This python script is a small command line utility that will parse VCF files into CSV files. It conforms to the specification given by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) and will create a CSV file keys mapped to columns.

I created this as a way to back up my icloud contacts in a file that could be processed more easily using CLI or text editor tools. It is basically the reverse of [This Repo](https://github.com/mridah/csv2vcf).

# Instalation and requirements

None really. Just a reasonably new version of python 3. It's tested to work on 3.8.13 and 3.10.6.

# Questions Bugs Etc?

Pleaes just submit an issue or PRs welcome.
